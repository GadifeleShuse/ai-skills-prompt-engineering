**Subject:** Update on WhatsApp Integration Project Timeline

Dear Stakeholders,

I hope this message finds you well.

I’m writing to inform you of a revised timeline for the WhatsApp integration project. Due to unforeseen technical challenges, we will be extending the delivery date by two weeks. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.

The delay stems from complexities in aligning our backend systems with WhatsApp’s API protocols, which required additional development and testing to ensure data integrity and security compliance. Our team has been working diligently to resolve these issues and maintain the quality standards expected for this integration.

### Revised Timeline:
- **Original Delivery Date:** [Insert original date]
- **New Delivery Date:** [Insert new date, two weeks later]

### Next Steps:
- Finalize API adjustments and conduct end-to-end testing by [insert date].
- Share updated documentation and walkthroughs with stakeholders by [insert date].
- Schedule a stakeholder review session to confirm readiness and address any final concerns.

We remain committed to delivering a robust and reliable solution and will keep you updated on progress. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss the revised plan in more detail.

Thank you for your continued support.

Warm regards,
